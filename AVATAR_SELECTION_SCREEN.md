# Avatar Selection Screen Implementation

## Overview
A beautifully animated avatar selection screen with dynamic gradient backgrounds, sliding carousel cards, and smooth button animations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Animated Gradient Background**
- Dynamic gradient that smoothly animates continuously
- Colors automatically change based on the selected avatar
- Uses `animateColorAsState` for smooth color transitions
- Implements infinite transition for the gradient movement effect

### 2. **Avatar Carousel with Sliding Animation**
- Displays 3 cards at once: previous, current (selected), and next
- Selected card is larger (280dp) and more prominent
- Side cards are smaller (200dp) and slightly transparent
- Smooth spring-based animations for:
  - Scale transformations
  - Opacity changes
  - Position transitions
- Swipe gestures to navigate between avatars
  - Swipe right: Shows previous avatar
  - Swipe left: Shows next avatar
  - Minimum drag threshold of 100px to trigger change

### 3. **Animated Continue Button**
- **On Screen Load**: Animates from scale 0 to 1 with a bouncy effect
- **On Click**: 
  - Shrinks to a circular shape
  - Shows a circular progress indicator
  - Runs for 1.5 seconds
  - Returns to normal state after completion
- **Responsive**: Disabled during loading state

## Components Breakdown

### `CreateProfileScreen`
Main screen composable containing:
- List of 9 avatars (avt_1 to avt_9)
- Color palette integration with `ColorSchema` function
- Predefined color schemes for each avatar
- Animated gradient background
- Layout structure with title, carousel, and button

### `AvatarCarousel`
Handles the sliding card functionality:
- Gesture detection for horizontal drag
- Automatic index management
- Smooth animations for card transitions
- Displays 3 cards simultaneously

### `AvatarCard`
Individual avatar card with:
- Rounded corners (32dp radius)
- Dynamic sizing based on selection state
- Scale and alpha animations
- Offset calculations for positioning

### `AnimatedContinueButton`
Interactive button with:
- Entrance animation
- Loading state animation
- Width and shape morphing
- Circular progress indicator

### `ColorSchema`
Generates color palette from selected avatar image using KMPalette library.

## Color Palettes
Each avatar has a predefined color scheme:
1. Indigo/Purple theme
2. Red/Pink theme
3. Cyan/Blue theme
4. Yellow/Amber theme
5. Emerald/Green theme
6. Orange/Red theme
7. Brown/Amber theme
8. Violet/Purple theme
9. Blue variants theme

## Usage
The screen automatically handles:
- Avatar selection state
- Color transitions
- Loading animations
- Swipe gestures

## Next Steps
To complete the implementation:
1. Uncomment and implement navigation in the button's onClick handler
2. Save the selected avatar to SharedViewModel or preferences
3. Add haptic feedback for better UX (optional)
4. Add page indicators to show which avatar is selected (optional)

## Dependencies Used
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- KMPalette for color extraction
- Kotlin Coroutines for async operations
- Navigation Component for screen transitions
